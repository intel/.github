# Develop on Intel, from AI PC to Data Center
Speed up AI development using IntelÂ®-optimized software on the latest IntelÂ® Coreâ„¢ Ultra processor, IntelÂ® XeonÂ® processor, IntelÂ® GaudiÂ® AI Accelerator, and GPU compute. You can get started right away on the [IntelÂ® Tiberâ„¢ AI Cloud](https://console.cloud.intel.com/docs/index.html) for free.

As a participant in the open source software community since 1989, Intel uses industry collaboration, co-engineering, and open source contributions to deliver a steady stream of code and optimizations that work across multiple platforms and use cases. We push our contributions upstream so developers get the most current and optimized software that works across multiple platforms and maintains security.

Check out the following respositories to jumpstart your development work on Intel:
- [OPEA GenAI Examples](https://github.com/opea-project/GenAIExamples) - Examples such as ChatQnA, Copilot, which illustrate the pipeline capabilities of the Open Platform for Enterprise AI (OPEA) project.
- [AI PC Notebooks](https://github.com/intel/AI-PC_Notebooks) - A collection of notebooks designed to showcase generative AI workloads on AI PC
